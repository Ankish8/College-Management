# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive college management system built for Jagran Lakecity University (JLU) Design Department, featuring advanced timetable management, attendance tracking, and student/faculty management. The system supports module-based teaching where subjects run for flexible durations with sophisticated conflict detection and auto-saving capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Core Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build production application  
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Database Management
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run Prisma migrations in development
- `npm run db:seed` - Seed database with sample JLU data
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset database and re-seed with sample data
- `npx prisma generate` - Generate Prisma client after schema changes
- `npx prisma studio` - Open Prisma Studio for database inspection

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI with Radix UI primitives
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (production ready)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v4 with JWT strategy
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Authentication System (NextAuth v4)
- Uses NextAuth v4 with credentials provider and JWT strategy
- Server-side session retrieval: `getServerSession(authOptions)`
- Client-side auth: `useSession()` from `next-auth/react`
- Role-based permissions: Admin, Faculty, Student with granular access controls
- Development credentials: 
  - Admin: admin@jlu.edu.in/admin123
  - Faculty: ankish.khatri@jlu.edu.in/password123
  - Student: virat@student.jlu.edu.in/password123

### Database Architecture (Prisma + SQLite)
**Core Hierarchy**: `University â†’ Department â†’ Program â†’ Specialization â†’ Batch â†’ Student`

**Key Models**:
- **User**: Base user with role (Admin/Faculty/Student), department assignment, status tracking
- **Student**: Extends User with studentId, rollNumber, batch assignment, guardian info
- **Batch**: Semester-based groups with capacity management and specialization linking
- **Subject**: Credit-based courses with primary/co-faculty assignment and configurable types
- **TimeSlot**: Admin-configurable time periods with duration and sort order
- **TimetableEntry**: Subject scheduling with conflict detection and entry types
- **AttendanceSession/AttendanceRecord**: Comprehensive attendance tracking with dispute resolution
- **AcademicCalendar/Holiday/ExamPeriod**: Academic year management with holidays
- **FacultyPreferences**: Faculty availability, blackout periods, workload limits
- **DepartmentSettings**: Configurable credit ratios, exam types, scheduling modes
- **BulkOperation**: Async operation tracking with progress and logging

**Advanced Features**:
- **Bulk Operations**: Async operations with progress tracking and detailed logging
- **Timetable Templates**: Reusable timetable patterns with Puck.js integration
- **Faculty Workload**: Automatic calculation with configurable limits
- **User Preferences**: View mode persistence and UI customization
- **Conflict Detection**: Real-time scheduling conflict prevention

### UI Framework & Components

â”œâ”€â”€ auth/[...nextauth]/         # NextAuth endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ batches/                    # Batch CRUD operations
â”œâ”€â”€ faculty/                    # Faculty management
â”œâ”€â”€ students/                   # Student operations
â”œâ”€â”€ subjects/                   # Subject management
â”œâ”€â”€ timetable/                  # Timetable operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bulk-operations/        # Async bulk operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conflicts/              # Conflict detection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ analytics/              # Timetable analytics

â””â”€â”€ user/preferences/           # User preference storage
```

### Component Organization
```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                         # Base Shadcn components
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/                       # Authentication components
â”œâ”€â”€ batches/                    # Batch management
â”œâ”€â”€ faculty/                    # Faculty interface
â”œâ”€â”€ students/                   # Student management
â”œâ”€â”€ subjects/                   # Subject operations
â”œâ”€â”€ timetable/                  # Timetable interface
â”œâ”€â”€ settings/                   # Configuration forms
â””â”€â”€ providers/                  # React context providers
```

### Type Safety
- `src/types/index.ts` - Extended Prisma types with relations
- `src/types/auth.ts` - Authentication-specific types
- `src/types/timetable.ts` - Timetable and scheduling types
- `src/types/preferences.ts` - User preference types
- All API operations use properly typed Prisma client with full relation support
