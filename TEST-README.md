- Navigation between pages

### Generated Reports
After each test run, you'll get:
- **HTML Report**: `test-results/test-report.html`
- **JSON Report**: `test-results/test-report.json`
- **Screenshots**: `test-results/screenshots/`
- **Videos**: `test-results/videos/` (on failures)
- **Traces**: `test-results/traces/` (for debugging)

## 🛠️ Test Architecture

### Helper Classes
- **AuthHelper**: Handles login/logout for all user roles
- **TestHelper**: Common testing utilities and screenshot capture
- **DatabaseHelper**: Database setup, teardown, and backup utilities
